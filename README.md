# Oracle Database with Visual Basic Front End Interface

This full-stack database application was developed based on a case study for a hypothetical insulation subcontracting firm called Insulation Unlimited Company. The company provides insulation installation, acoustic engineering, and asbestos removal services to homeowners, general contractors, and government agencies.

This application manages the complete workflow from initial job proposals through work orders, task scheduling, and final invoicing, with particular emphasis on job costing by tracking labor and materials attributed to each job.
