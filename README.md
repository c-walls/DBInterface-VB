# Oracle Database with Visual Basic Front End Interface

This full-stack database system was developed for Insulation Unlimited Company, a hypothetical insulation subcontracting firm with three semi-independent offices in the Seattle area. The company provides insulation installation, acoustic engineering, and asbestos removal services to homeowners, general contractors, and government agencies.

The system addresses the unique challenges of subcontracting work, focusing on material and labor tracking rather than the broader project management needs of general contractors. It manages the complete workflow from initial job proposals through work orders, task scheduling, and final invoicing, with particular emphasis on job costing - tracking labor and materials attributed to each job.

## Development Process
1. **Requirements Analysis**
   - Analyzed subcontractor-specific business needs
   - Documented workflow processes from proposal to invoice
   - Defined business rules and relationships between entities
   - Identified key data tracking requirements for materials and labor

2. **Database Design**
   - Created Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)
   - Implemented normalized database schema
   - Established relationships between business entities
   - Designed data validation rules and constraints

3. **Interface Development**
   - Built Windows Forms application for data entry and management
   - Implemented forms for proposals, work orders, and invoicing
   - Created dashboard for real-time project tracking
   - Integrated automated work order and invoice generation

4. **Technical Documentation**
   - Compiled comprehensive database schema documentation
   - Created detailed Entity Relationship Diagrams
   - Documented business rules and workflow processes
   - Developed user guides and training materials
   - Generated interface specifications and form field descriptions

## Tech Stack
Built with Oracle Cloud Database and SQL Developer for backend development, Visual Basic Windows Forms for the frontend interface, and version control through Git.
